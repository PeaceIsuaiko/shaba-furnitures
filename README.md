✅ Cart Page Progress
You're currently focused on building the Cart page with these components:

Cart: Wraps all other cart components

CartList: Displays each selected product (image, name, price, quantity buttons, remove button)

Head: Contains a back button, navigation, and a short message

Summary: Shows subtotal, shipping, total price, and a call-to-action

Footer: Optional

✅ Product Page Development
Working on Products.jsx:

Uses default products from products.json

Has a custom product search via an API with a SearchBar

Reuses ProductList for rendering results

Styled with TailwindCSS
